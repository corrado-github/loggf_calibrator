# Transition probability calibrator

This software is a semi-automatic tool to perform astrophysical calibration
of atomic transition probabilities to be used in stellar spectra synthesis.
It has been used to create a astrophysically calibrated atomic line list
for the creation of the General Curve of Growths library necessary for the
SP_Ace software ().

It is ``semi-automatic" because the calibration process is performed
interactively. The used can check the calibration for smll wavelenght
intervals step by step, or run it in batch mode. The results can be
visualized and the lines can be added, removed, or modified by the user.

## Disclamer

Although the software is released under GLP licence, the version here
presented miss of some fundamental data necessary to make it run. I decided
to not put here the data because, although these are public data, they are
not my work. Therefore, if anybody download this software and run it, it
will not work. If anybody is actually interested to run it, please contact
me privately.

## Use
The code has been designed to standardize and make user friendly the
calibration process. I build a graphic user interface (GUI) from where the
user can check and control the whole process.
