This is the directory where the atomic parameters line lists and hyperfine
splitting lines are found.  It contains the line list retrieved from VALD
atomic database (http://vald.astro.uu.se/) and from Kurucz work (Kurucz, R. 
L.  1995, in ASP Conf.Ser 78, Astrophysical Application of Powerful New
Database, ed.  S.J.  Adelman, W.L.  Wiese, (San Francisco, CA), 205).

These data are publicly available. However this is not my work,
therefore I do not publish them in Github. If interested, please contact me
privatly.
