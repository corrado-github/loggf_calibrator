This is the directory where the atomic parameters line lists and hyperfine
splitting lines are found.  It contains the line list created by Cris Sneden
and his collaborators (that's where the directory's name come from).  It
contains the transition probabilities for hyperfine splitting lines of
Vanadium, Manganese, and Cobalt.  Credits:
