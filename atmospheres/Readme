This is the directory where the Kurucz atmosphere models are found. 
Besides, here are allocated data files containig information about the
chemical abundances of the standard stars (abd_star*.dat used by SPECTRUM)
to synhesize the spectra as well as the files used by the calibrator
software (star*.abd).

The atmosphere models are derived from the ATLAS9 grid by Castelli and Kurucz
(2003, in IAUS symp.  210, Modelling of Stellar Atmospheres, ed.  N. 
Piskunov, W.W.  Wiess and D.F.  Gray , Published on behalf of the IAU by the
ASP, 20). 
These are publicly available. However this is not my work,
therefore I do not publish them in Github. If interested, please contact me
privatly.
